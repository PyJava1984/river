Provides I/O interfaces and utility classes.

<h2><code>Portable</code></h2>

<p>The interface {@link org.apache.river.api.io.Portable} may be
implemented by an object that is required to be immutable and thread safe
immediately after un-marshalling, <code>Portable</code> object's do not
implement {@link java.io.Serializable}, their fields may be private and they 
are created by a single reflective invocation of a public constructor, static
method or <code>Serializable</code> object's builder method.

<h2><code>PortableObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>PortableObjectInputStream</code></h2>

<p>The classes {@link net.jini.io.MarshalOutputStream} and {@link
net.jini.io.MarshalInputStream} extend the Portable object serialization stream
classes {@link org.apache.river.api.io.PortableObjectOutputStream} and {@link
org.apache.river.api.io.PortableObjectInputStream} that implement replacement of
{@link org.apache.river.api.io.Portable} objects with 
{@link org.apache.river.api.io.PortableFactory} during marshalling and
substitution of <code>PortableFactory</code> with an object created by
<code>PortableFactory</code>upon unmarshalling.

<h2><code>PortableFactory</code></h2>

<p>A {@link org.apache.river.api.io.PortableFactory} contains Externalized 
instructions for creating an Object using reflection upon unmarshalling.

<h2><code>PortablePermission</code></h2>

<p>A {@link org.apache.river.api.io.PortablePermission} guards the 
    {@link java.io.Externalizable#writeExternal} method of 
    <code>PortableFactory</code>, preventing unauthorised marshalling.

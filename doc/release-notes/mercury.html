<H3>Description</H3>
"Mercury" is the name of the contributed Jini(TM) event mailbox
service implementation from Sun Microsystems. The <i>Jini(TM) Event Mailbox
Specification</i> is available in <a
href="../specs/html/mailbox-spec.html">HTML</a>.

<H3>Changes since the v2.0.1 release</H3>

  <dt> <b>"Pull" Functionality</b>
  <dd> The Jini(TM) Event Mailbox Service 
       <a href="../specs/html/mailbox-spec.html">Specification</a>
       was augmented with additional classes and
       interfaces that provide synchronous access to 
       events (see sections EM.5-EM.7). Mercury was also 
       updated to implement this new functionality. <BR>
       The following work still needs to be done:
       <UL>
       <LI>Implement the timeout functionality for 
           <code>RemoteEventIterator.next</code>
       <LI>Make the batching implementation configurable. For example,
           configuring the number of events that get returned to the 
           event mailbox client in a single call. Currently all the available 
           events are sent.

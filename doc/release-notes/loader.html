<H3>Description</H3>

<p>The <a
href="../api/net/jini/loader/package-summary.html"><code>net.jini.loader</code></a>
package and its subpackages provide APIs related to dynamic class
loading and, in particular, <i>preferred classes</i>.

<dt><b>Difference in behavior between
<code>PreferredClassProvider</code> and the default
<code>RMIClassLoader</code> provider</b>

<dd><p><a
href="../api/net/jini/loader/pref/PreferredClassProvider.html"><code>PreferredClassProvider</code></a>
has the following difference in behavior from the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/rmi/server/RMIClassLoader.html#getDefaultProviderInstance()">default
<code>RMIClassLoader</code> provider</a> even when no preferred lists
are used:

<p>For a given class loader, <a
href="../api/net/jini/loader/pref/PreferredClassProvider.html#loadClass(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.ClassLoader)"><code>PreferredClassProvider.loadClass</code></a>
assumes that any class that can be downloaded from the codebase
annotation for classes defined by the loader can always be loaded by
the loader.  Therefore, when attempting to load a class from a given
codebase, if the current thread's context class loader or one of its
ancestor loaders has that codebase as its annotation, then
<code>PreferredClassProvider.loadClass</code> will only attempt to
load the class from that loader instead of from one of its own loaders
that downloads from the codebase.

<p>The default <code>RMIClassLoader</code> provider does not make this
assumption; its <code>loadClass</code> method will attempt to download
a class from a codebase even if a class loader with that codebase as
its annotation (such as the current thread's context class loader or
one of its ancestors) could not load the class.

<p><code>PreferredClassProvider.loadClass</code> makes the assumption
in order to avoid incorrectly returning a preferred class defined by a
different class loader (and thus with a different runtime type) than
that of a locally available class with the same name and codebase
annotation.

<p>In versions of the Norm implementation of the River lease
renewal service prior to v2.0, there are some classes in
<code>norm-dl.jar</code> that are not in <code>norm.jar</code>, and
thus Norm will fail to start with <code>PreferredClassProvider</code>
configured as the <code>RMIClassLoader</code> provider.  This problem
can be worked around by using the default <code>RMIClassLoader</code>
provider instead of <code>PreferredClassProvider</code>, or by using
the current version of Norm.

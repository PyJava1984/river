<H3>Description</H3>

&quot;Outrigger&quot; is the name of the contributed JavaSpaces service
from Sun Microsystems.  The primary interface implemented by Outrigger is the
<code><a
href="../api/net/jini/space/JavaSpace05.html">net.jini.space.JavaSpace05</a></code>
interface (note, <code>JavaSpace05</code> extends the
<code>net.jini.space.JavaSpace</code> interface so any implementation of
<code>JavaSpace05</code> can also be used as a <code>JavaSpace</code>). For
a listing of the additional interfaces implemented by Outrigger, please
consult <a
href="../api/com/sun/jini/outrigger/package-summary.html">Outrigger's
package documentation</a>.

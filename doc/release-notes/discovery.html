<h1>River Discovery Utilities<BR>
v2.1.2 Release Notes</h1>
</center>
<HR>
<UL>
<H3>Description</H3>
The River discovery utilities contain
a set of discovery management interfaces that define the policies to
apply when implementing helper utilities that manage an entity's
discovery duties: in particular, the management of multicast (group)
discovery and unicast (locator) discovery. The discovery management
interfaces are:
<p>
  <ul>

    <li> <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/DiscoveryManagement.html">        <code>net.jini.discovery.DiscoveryManagement</code></a>
    <li> <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/DiscoveryGroupManagement.html">   <code>net.jini.discovery.DiscoveryGroupManagement</code></a>
    <li> <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/DiscoveryLocatorManagement.html"> <code>net.jini.discovery.DiscoveryLocatorManagement</code></a>
  </ul>
<p>
The discovery utilities also include a set of standard helper utility 
classes that implement one or more of the discovery management 
interfaces. The helper utility classes are:
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/LookupDiscovery.html">        <code>net.jini.discovery.LookupDiscovery</code></a>
    <li> <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/LookupLocatorDiscovery.html"> <code>net.jini.discovery.LookupLocatorDiscovery</code></a>
    <li> <a href="../api/net/jini/discovery/LookupDiscoveryManager.html"> <code>net.jini.discovery.LookupDiscoveryManager</code></a>
  </ul>
<p>
Additional classes and packages:

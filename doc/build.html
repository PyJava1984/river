<title>Building the Jini Technology Packages</title>
<a name="TOP">
<center><h1>Building the Jini Technology Packages</h1></center>

<br>
The Jini Technology Starter Kit (starter kit) includes support for 
generating binary (JAR) files and documentation from the provided source code
using the Apache Ant build tool (available from the Ant project site at
Apache.org, <a href="http://ant.apache.org">
               <code>http://ant.apache.org</code></a>). 
<p>
This page describes how to use <code>ant</code> to build the starter kit from
the source code. This Ant build process was originally based on Geoff Arnold's
Ant build script, located at <a href="http://user-garnold.jini.org">
<code>http://user-garnold.jini.org</code></a>, and we thank him for his
contribution.

<p>
It is not necessary to build the JAR files from source code to get started with
Jini technology.  The JAR files are provided for you as part of the starter kit,
depending on your installation options.  The location of the JAR files is 
documented in <a href="info-index.html#examine">info-index.html</a> .  In the
instructions below, <B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B> is the directory into which
you installed the starter kit distribution.

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>:<i> Please do not attempt to build the starter kit JAR files
without first taking referencing the 
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/products/jini/tested.html"> 
platforms on which the starter kit has been tested</a></i>.

<p>
<hr>
<h2>Build instructions</h2>

<p>
The following prerequisites must be met before a build can be executed:
<ul>
  <li>	
    The <b><code>bin</code></b> directory of the Java(TM) 2 SDK, Standard
    Edition, v 1.4 (or later) must be in your executable search path. You can
    obtain the Java software at <a href="http://java.sun.com">
    <code>http://java.sun.com</code></a> . 
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    The <b><code>JAVA_HOME</code></b> environment variable must be set to the
    full path of the top-level directory of the installed Java2 SDK software.
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    Apache Ant, version 1.6.2 or later, must be installed on your system.  You
    can obtain the Ant software from Ant's project site at
    <a href="http://ant.apache.org"><code>http://ant.apache.org</code></a> . 
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>
    The <b><code>ANT_HOME</code></b> environment variable must be set to the
    full path of the top-level directory of the installed Ant software.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The following build options are currently available:
<ul>
  <li>	
    The <b><code>JAVADEBUG</code></b> environment can be used to override the
    default debuglevel values.  The possible values are "<code>none</code>",
    "<code>lines</code>", "<code>source</code>", and "<code>vars</code>".
    If two or more values are used together, they must be comma-separated
    (eg, "<code>lines,source,vars</code>").  Refer to the javac documentation
    or the javac task section of the Ant documentation for further details
    regarding these debuglevel options.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To build the starter kit JAR files, you must:

<pre>
    cd <B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/source

    ant &lt;<i>target</i>&gt;
</pre>

where the basic targets are:
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>
    <b>all</b><br>
    This target is also the default target and can be invoked by simply running
    <code>ant</code> without specifying any target.  This target compiles the
    class files for all of the starter kit source code, generates Java Remote
    Method Invocation (Java RMI) stub classes, and generates the configentry 
    files.  The class files and configentry files will be placed in the following
    directories, respectively:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/source/classes</code>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/source/configentry</code> 

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>jars</b><br>
    Creates the JAR files for the starter kit, using the compiled class files.
    The compiled class files must already have been created.  The resulting JAR
    files will be placed in the following directories:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/source/lib</code>    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/source/lib-dl</code> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/source/lib-ext</code><br>
    <br>
    <b>NOTE</b>:
    <br>
    <i>
    During the jars build, warning messages similar to the following are generated:
    </i>
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>[java] Nested class LogManager$Probe has different preferred state than outer class LogManager</code>
    <br><br>
    <i>
    Messages of this sort are expected and pose no concern to the resulting build.
    </i>

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>clean</b><br>
    Removes the class files, configentry files, docs, JAR files, and all associated
    directories generated during the build.

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>doc</b> or <b>javadoc</b><br>
    Generates API documentation for the starter kit, using the Javadoc(TM) tool.
    The documentation will be placed in the following directory:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/source/doc/api</code>

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>spec-doc</b><br>
    Generates the specification-only documentation for the starter kit, using the Javadoc(TM) tool.
    The documentation will be placed in the following directory:
    <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code><B><VAR>install_dir</VAR></B>/source/doc/specs/api</code>

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>build.release</b><br>
    This target will compile everything, generate the jar files, generate the javadoc,
    and produce the distribution bundles (binary and source) in the top-level "dist"
    directory.

    <p>
    <dt>
    <b>release</b><br>
    This target assumes everything is built and will only produce distribution bundles
    (binary and source) in the top-level "dist" directory.

  </dl>
